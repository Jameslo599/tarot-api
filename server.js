    description:
      "The Magician card in Tarot represents a street magician dressed in fancy garb, resembling a wizard using mysterious powers to change events in real life. The elongated form between the legs can be seen as the gate to a magical reality, which can be used to focus our attention during a magical ceremony or guided imagination. The card can also signify a new beginning and a willingness to learn and develop, with the foot on the right touching an open white surface representing a step towards an undefined future. However, the card can also symbolize an immature and self-centered personality. Overall, the card represents the power of thought to create reality and the use of sorcery for good ends. \n \n The Magician utilizes various tools, some of which are more recognizable than others. Three tools on the table resemble symbols from the minor suits: a cup, a knife (which may represent swords), and circular objects resembling coins. Along with the wand held by the magician, we can see symbols from the four suits that represent different aspects of earthly life. This card may symbolize the tools and resources available to the querent, suggesting the possibility of acquiring new professional skills or using existing resources in creative ways. \n \n The wand and the oddly-shaped object in the magicianâ€™s right hand may represent masculine and feminine symbols, which he points towards each other. The magician attempts to unite opposites. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the wand's line passes above the other shape rather than straight through it. This may indicate an unaccomplished task or the experience of missing a goal due to imprecision or carelessness. Additionally, one may also view this as a missed opportunity for conception, where an egg fails to fertilize with sperm. \n \n The Magician is a captivating figure, often dressed in fancy clothing, who creates illusions through calculated tricks. This card can represent someone with personal charm, charisma, and persuasive qualities, or someone involved in show business, sales, or public relations. However, the Magician can also be a deceitful charlatan or con artist. \n \n A more philosophical interpretation suggests that the Magician symbolizes the idea that our earthly reality and sense of self are illusions created by our consciousness. The card's number represents individuality, while the table and tools represent the objects and situations we perceive in this illusionary world. The Magician's feet, pointing in opposite directions under the table, suggest hesitancy and indecision, while the table itself may symbolize a blockage of sexual or creative energy. The Magician's incomplete field of vision and lack of self-awareness can indicate inner confusion or ignorance of important factors, but may also represent untapped potential and opportunities.",

  popess: {
    name: "The Popess",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/tQ1Mvnz/a02.jpg",
    description:
      "The card known as 'The High Priestess' in English is referred to as 'La Papesse' in French, which translates to 'the Popess.' The card may be connected to the legend of Pope Joan, a philosophy teacher in 9th-century Rome who disguised herself as a man to teach due to societal conventions. Her great wisdom made her popular and eventually led to her being elected as Pope. However, her secret was exposed when she gave birth during a procession, and she was stoned to death along with her baby. \n \n The Popess symbolizes wisdom, similar to goddesses of wisdom in various mythologies. The narrow title band at the top of the card and the Popess' tiara extending high may suggest a higher kind of wisdom or intuition from a sublime source. The turn towards the left, signifying the past, hints at possessing ancient or traditional knowledge. The Popess' open book indicates her ability to understand and express this knowledge in words. She is willing to share her knowledge, but one must make an effort to receive and understand it. \n \n The card can represent ancient wisdom, possibly with a feminine character, such as traditional knowledge passed down between women. It may also refer to subversive knowledge that undermines established conventions and existing power structures. The Popess can symbolize a spiritual mother or guide, offering wise advice and guidance. \n \n The Popess sets boundaries, expressed through her heavily covered chest area and completely hidden pelvis and legs. She only expresses herself in the intellectual domain, and even then, in a controlled and limited manner. The card can symbolize a closed and protective attitude, lack of sensuality, or Puritan conservatism. It can also indicate setting firm barriers for oneself or others, both morally and psychologically. \n \n The Popess hides her powers, similar to Pope Joan concealing her femininity and strengths in a male-dominated world. The card may represent a woman adopting 'masculine' attitudes to be accepted in a professional environment. It can also suggest a reluctance to accept a relationship where the woman has more abilities or a higher social status than her partner. For men, the card might signify pressure to hide traits that are considered feminine. Generally, the card can symbolize the need to conceal personal characteristics that go against societal norms. On the other hand, it might represent a modest person who doesn't boast about their qualities. \n \n The Popess card is often associated with secrecy. The Popess herself is veiled, and the screen behind her seems to guard something hidden. This card can indicate personal secrets, covert actions, or discreet matters that should be kept hidden. It might also suggest a spiritual secret that only the worthy can know. However, in a negative sense, the card could mean excessive secrecy or difficulty opening up. \n \n Interestingly, the Popess card can also refer to the reading itself. As a figure who knows secrets 'from behind the veil,'' the Popess may represent the reader. The card might also suggest that the querent is hiding something from us. If it appears as the last card in a reading, it could mean that the answer to the query is hidden and cannot be revealed at this time.",

  empress: {
    name: "The Empress",

    description:
      "The heraldic eagle is a well-known symbol of European royalty, often paired with a scepter topped with a cross and sphere. These same elements can be found in The Emperor tarot card, suggesting that the two figures are related, possibly even married. The eagle shield represents legitimacy, tradition, and family heritage, while the scepter symbolizes power and authority. The Emperor seems to rely on external means of control, whereas the Empress embodies personal power and intuition. \n \n The Empress card represents fertility and growth, similar to the concept of 'mother earth' found in many cultures. Sensuality and passion are also suggested in the card's rounded lower body and the scepter emerging from the pelvis. The number 3 and triangular composition reinforce the themes of fertility, creativity, and growth. The Empress can be interpreted as a positive sign for advancing projects or abundance and prosperity. \n \n The Empress can also represent motherhood, with the eagle coat-of-arms symbolizing the imperial family. The card may indicate a protective mother figure, either literal or symbolic, or a desire for motherhood. \n \n The Empress card combines natural and artificial elements, with flowing lines and soft shapes mixed with sharp angles and stripes. This can symbolize a touch of warmth and humanity within a structured system, or a desire to reconnect with nature in a modern world. \n \n The Empress card displays a large scepter leaning on the bosom, which hints at the suit of wands and the domain of desires and creativity. This can indicate an action driven by passion rather than calculated reasoning. However, the eagle on the card can also be interpreted as a symbol of intellect, suggesting that rationality is integrated with feelings and passions. The eagle's gaze is directed towards the scepter base, indicating that the intellect serves to control and direct the expression of desires. \n \n The Empress card is often interpreted as representing female power. It depicts a woman in a strong and dominant position, displaying her femininity as a source of power. However, there are also some masculine traits present, such as a trace of an Adam's apple on her neck and the large scepter growing from her abdomen, which can be seen as a phallic symbol. These traits further manifest her self-confidence and willingness to employ power and authority to impose her will.",

  emperor: {
    name: "The Emperor",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/NsKRzLP/a04.jpg",
    description:
      "The Emperor's crown resembles that of a noble warrior from the Middle Ages and signifies their role as both a ruler and fighter. The eagle on the emblem represents the Holy Roman Empire, which granted authority and legitimacy to the kingdoms and principalities of central Europe. The object in the Emperor's right hand combines two traditional royal symbols - a scepter representing power and authority and a spherical orb with a cross denoting that earthly rule is subordinate to spiritual law. In medieval terms, the Emperor's figure represents the earthly authority of the state as opposed to the spiritual authority of the church. \n \n The Emperor card symbolizes stability in the material domain and can represent authority in the earthly domain, such as a government official, military commander, or company manager. It may also indicate a stable material status or a wealthy person and refer to the querent's source of income, such as their workplace. The Emperor is an imposing figure who gives orders and expects obedience. The scepter as a phallic symbol can represent male domination, but it can also symbolize desire and creativity. \n \n The Emperor card represents a strong personality, self-confidence, assertiveness, and leadership. On the negative side, it can express a dictator, a tyrannical personality, or a constant need for control. It can also indicate a macho attitude towards women. The Emperor's eagle represents intellect and reason, but the Emperor's actual power and domination depend on their ability to use force. The Emperor's masculine authority can symbolize a traditional fatherly image, and the card may refer to the querent's role of fatherhood or to their own father. \n \n The Emperor card can express determination, assertiveness, self-confidence, and a willingness to fight and protect one's ground. It can also symbolize a belligerent and aggressive attitude or someone who is readily provoked and prone to anger. The tense sitting posture can indicate fear of real or imaginary enemies, which makes the querent always stay on their guard. The Emperor's left hand holding the belt and the crossed legs indicate self-containment, discipline, and putting spiritual and moral values above personal desires. \n \n The Emperor is expected to lead with self-discipline and impeccable behavior, according to traditional codes of honor for nobility. However, some may interpret his crossed leg as a sign of blockage, especially when paired with his gaze to the left. The Emperor's power is mainly derived from past achievements of his predecessors, making him conservative in his attitude and hesitant to relinquish his current position. \n \n When examining the card, the upper left quarter showcases the Emperor's power and control with clear shapes, while the lines on the right side are more rounded and the earth's contours are ambiguous. The lower part of the shield may even imply a hole, representing the depths of the soul or vulnerability not shown on the surface. This card may represent a person who hides their fears and weaknesses behind a tough or powerful exterior. For instance, someone who is afraid to open up in an intimate relationship and sets up defenses, reacting aggressively to anyone attempting to reach them.",

  pope: {
    name: "The Pope",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/7KYtw4t/a05.jpg",
    description:
      "The Le Pape card in the Tarot deck represents the Catholic pope and his attributes. The Pope is depicted with his right hand in a Latin gesture of benediction, and small crosses on his hands symbolize the gloves typically worn by popes. The papal tiara features three crowns, representing the Church's dominion on earth. Historically, popes also had beards and carried a triple-barred cross as a symbol of the Holy Trinity. \n \n The lower part of the card shows two figures with their backs to us, indicating they are likely members or aspirants of the Catholic clergy. The Pope appears to be teaching and guiding them, and the yellow circle on the left may represent a hat taken off in respect. The Pope card can represent a figure of authority offering guidance and advice to the querent, indicating good advice should be listened to. \n \n As the head of the Church, the Pope represents institutional knowledge and values with a long tradition and well-established institutions. The card may refer to any such kind of institutional knowledge, such as a school, university, hospital, or court. It can also indicate advice from a professional expert, such as a medical doctor, therapist, lawyer, or coach. \n \n The Pope card can also represent a spiritual father or teacher, a religious leader, spiritual guide, or guru. It can even represent a part of our own personality, expressing our moral conscience, the education we received, and the values we absorbed in our childhood. \n \n The Pope's right hand points upwards in a benediction gesture, suggesting the road to salvation passes through the church that he represents. However, the card can also represent someone who expresses their own prejudices and limitations, pretending they represent heaven's decree or an objective reality. \n \n The Pope's flesh-colored gloves make it difficult to separate his personal identity from the institution he represents. This could mean that he identifies with the values and norms of the system he belongs to, and genuinely practices what he preaches. However, it could also indicate blind obedience to an established system, such as a public institution or commercial firm, or a person who upholds conservative and conformist values. \n \n In the card, the Pope shows a preference for the disciple on the right and seems to ignore the one on the left. While this could be due to a justified reason, it could also represent unfairness, discrimination, and prejudice. For example, it could be an institution that favors those who conform to the norms and rejects those who are different and dissenting. The card could also signify a preference for one child over others in a family. Moreover, the light-blue shape under the raised hand of the disciple on the right could be a hidden knife, hinting at possible betrayal by the preferred one.",

  lover: {
    name: "The Lover",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/M8Y2XQ1/a06.jpg",
    description:
      "The card known as 'The Lovers' in English decks, but called 'L'amoureux' in French, signifies a singular lover. The image depicts a central male figure with Cupid above, implying that he is in love. However, the women on either side of him are linked to a story about Hercules, who faced a choice between a path of easy satisfaction and sensual pleasures or one of wisdom, virtue, and self-control. \n \n The meaning and design of the card have changed over time in the two Tarot schools, causing confusion and complexity. While the name and Cupid's arrow suggest love, the story of Hercules is about choice, and there are diverse mythological references attached to the card. Some authors associate it with Prince Paris' choice between three goddesses, which led to the Trojan War. In the Golden Dawn deck, the image was replaced by Perseus saving Andromeda from a sea monster, and the card was renamed 'The Lovers' in plural. Waite redesigned the card with Adam and Eve, removing pagan references. \n \n The English school interprets the card as a romantic relationship, either literally or as a metaphor for heavenly love. The entangled arms and mutual touching of the three figures can indicate a complex relationship involving multiple people. The mature figure may be the man's mother, pushing him to find a bride with one hand and weighing on his shoulder with the other to make him stay with her. A male figure may represent a woman and vice versa. \n \n Many French authors emphasize the aspect of choice, even naming the card 'The Two Paths.' The feet pointing in both directions suggest a dilemma, with external influences acting from different directions. The body leans toward the young woman, but the head turns toward the older one, signifying desires and emotions tending toward the first direction while reason tends toward the second. It can represent a difficulty in choosing between the path of desire and the path of wisdom, whether in romance or other matters. \n \n The French school links the card to the shape of the letter Y, symbolizing the choices a person makes in youth. The bifurcation point in the center is the course of childhood, where a small push to the right or left may decide which road to take. Once life advances along one branch, it becomes difficult and impossible to reverse the choice. The hand on the young woman's belly may suggest future pregnancy, depending on the lover's choice. The card may indicate a significant long-term decision, such as choices made as a young adult or the joint decision of a couple to have a child. It can signify a meaningful decision in other areas as well. \n \n The Lover card in Tarot is influenced by one's past experiences and relationships. The mature woman on the left of the card represents the impact of past figures of authority. The man's gaze towards her may suggest that the individual is still holding onto old patterns of thinking. This can make it difficult for them to let go of existing relationships and habits. Additionally, if the individual has made a decision in the past, they may be struggling with doubts and regrets instead of moving forward. \n \n The card also suggests that one should pay attention to signs and coincidences that may be guiding them towards a particular path. The Cupid on the card may represent an angel, and his arrow pointing towards the young woman symbolizes a sign from heaven. The woman's hand on the man's heart indicates that she is the one who has won his affection. The foot turned in her direction further emphasizes this point. \n \n If the querent is facing a dilemma, the card suggests that they should rely on their intuition and feelings rather than rational considerations. They should pay attention to small indicators such as which romantic partner they call more often or visit more frequently. These small choices can hint at the orientation of their heart and guide them towards the right decision.",

  chariot: {
    name: "The Chariot",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/VQGWXVB/a07.jpg",
    description:
      "The card known as 'The Chariot' has been linked to various deities and historical figures, but its illustration resembles a popular medieval story about Alexander the Great. Alexander harnessed two gryphons to his chariot and attempted to conquer the sky, but a flying wonder-man warned him to give up his plan. The card represents a victorious march and the overcoming of obstacles, with the warrior garb symbolizing the importance of being daring and ready to fight. The letters 'V.T.' on the chariot's front plate may have various meanings depending on the reading. The card's structure combines solidity with movement, and its ethereal base suggests that the solid structures of status and power may have no real basis. The card may represent an advance towards a desired goal or matters related to vehicles. \n \n The Chariot was once a symbol of high rank and excellence, bestowed upon individuals by rulers. Today, luxurious cars serve as a similar status symbol. The square shape and four poles of the chariot suggest prestige and dominance in the material world. The fleur-de-lys shape, a symbol of the French royal house of Bourbon, appears on the front plate and crown decorations. The Chariot card can represent prestige and honor, ambition for high social status, or benefits gained through service to those in power. However, it may also signify snobbery, opportunism, and a desire to advance at any cost. \n \n The Chariot provides protection from the outside world with its armor, crown, spear, and sturdy body. These features create a solid enclosure around the rider, leaving only their hands and face exposed. This may suggest an appearance of confidence and power, but could also hide a weak personality. The card can symbolize reliance on external means instead of utilizing inner resources, or dependence on technology and material possessions to the detriment of human connection. In relationships, the rider's overprotectiveness may indicate fear of intimacy and emotional blockages. The card can also represent vanity, arrogance, and over-confidence that lead to dangerous situations. \n \n The Chariot can also symbolize a lack of control. The rider holds no reins, and it appears as if the horses are pulling the chariot as they please. The face-masks on the shoulders represent conflicting thoughts and opposing desires. This may suggest uncertainty about goals or reliance on external factors like status and assets to determine one's path. The card can also signify a young person's natural ambition, self-assured and optimistic about conquering the world.",

  justice: {
    name: "Justice",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/YZ6yyWf/a08.jpg",
    description:
      "During the Middle Ages, Christian morality adopted the idea of four cardinal virtues from Greek philosophy, including Justice, Force, Temperance, and Prudence. These virtues are depicted in the Tarot, with Justice being represented by a figure holding a sword and scales, which is still recognized as a symbol of the judicial system today. The scales were originally used by the Egyptian goddess of justice, Maat, to weigh the heart of a deceased person against a feather. The sword and scales are also associated with the Archangel Michael in Christian paintings of the Last Judgment. \n \n The Justice card in the Tarot represents fairness and balance, often related to legal matters. It can indicate a legal proceeding or a judge, and suggests that justice will be served. The scales represent the weighing of evidence, but they also symbolize equal distribution. The sword can represent punishment for wrongdoing, or a critical and judgmental mindset. It can also suggest the need for a clear decision or cutting ties with the past. Overall, the Justice card encourages introspection and a balanced approach to decision-making. \n \n The Justice card represents reason and precision, as symbolized by the number 8, the orderly posture, and straight lines. It highlights intellectual dominance through the sword and crown. Furthermore, it can indicate clear thinking and adherence to social norms or a rigid and conformist attitude. \n \n The upper part of the card displays an artificial and precise nature, while the lower part features wavy earth and soft lines, showcasing emotional closure and strong desires. The scales, where the upper part controls the lower, highlight the domination of the mind over passions. The sword can express self-discipline or sharp self-criticism. \n \n The scales and sword tilt slightly to the right, symbolizing the future. It represents the intervention of Justice to tip the scales to the side of merit, which signifies good deeds. The card suggests the need for a human touch beyond strict application of the law and a touch of grace in rational considerations. An inverted card indicates unfair and crooked judgment.",

  hermit: {
    name: "The Hermit",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/nr6jygN/a09.jpg",
    description:
      "The term 'hermit' comes from a Greek word meaning 'desert.' The Hermit card is associated with the Christian tradition of solitary monks who lived in the desert and practiced self-deprivation and penance. The card's depiction of a bearded figure with long, uncut hair is a traditional symbol of asceticism in various religions. The object in the Hermit's hand, which resembles a lamp, is reminiscent of the Greek philosopher Diogenes, who chose to live in poverty and was once seen walking in broad daylight with a lit candle in his hand, searching for an honest and virtuous human being. \n \n In the tarot, the Hermit card represents a search for truth, whether it be a psychological or spiritual journey. The three horizontal lines on the Hermit's forehead can symbolize wisdom and enlightenment, and can also represent the three layers of the major suit cards: heaven, earth, and the abyss. The Hermit's gaze and posture are focused on his goal, representing determination and willingness to make sacrifices for its sake. However, the card can also express a conservative attitude and a refusal to compromise with reality. \n \n The Hermit card also signifies self-deprivation and asceticism, as well as a simple and modest lifestyle. This can be a choice for life or a temporary stage that the querent is undergoing. The image of a monk or hermit also suggests celibacy and giving up satisfaction of any kind of desire. The Hermit card may hint at hidden and deviant passions under the guise of a puritan mantle. \n \n The Hermit card in tarot may represent a period of self-examination and inactivity. The hermit could be reflecting on their past experiences to better understand how they affect their present life. Additionally, the card can represent prudence and caution before making any moves. On the negative side, the card may indicate difficulty in trusting others and a fear of intimacy. In romantic matters, the card may represent a period of solitude or a feeling of alienation in an existing relationship. It's important to be cautious but not overly suspicious in relationships.",

  "wheel-of-fortune": {
    name: "The Wheel of Fortune",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/c8NxBjY/a10.jpg",
    description:
      "The card is named after Fortuna, the Roman goddess of luck, and features a wheel as a symbol of life's ups and downs. The wheel, depicted with four figures in medieval paintings, represents ascending, reigning, descending, and having no reign. The wheel's turning is also the origin of the word 'revolution.' The Wheel card conveys the message that life is a series of successes and failures, and even if one is currently on a descent, an ascent will eventually follow. However, the positions on the wheel change both ways, and whoever is down now will eventually move up, and whoever is up will come down. The card's interpretation depends on neighboring cards, as the card on the right indicates a rising factor, while the card on the left indicates a falling one. \n \n In Renaissance thinking, the wheel symbolized capricious luck, as opposed to personal merit, and arbitrary fortune, different from destiny that drives events towards a fixed goal. The card can also represent gambling, with the combination of animal and human parts representing the strange combinations of animal drives and human considerations with which one reacts to life's changes. The card warns against assuming that the same wheels will turn in the same way indefinitely, as an unexpected change in conditions or an exception that doesn't fit fixed rules may disrupt the machinery of a bureaucratic system. The wheel moves by itself, with no one holding the handle, and the querent's situation may change for better or worse due to random external forces they cannot control. However, checking the next card may reveal someone or something turning the wheel and manipulating the querent's situation. \n \n The Wheel represents cycles of repetition and change, such as the cycles of day and night, summer and winter, and the cycles of life. It can also symbolize astrological and biorhythmic cycles, as well as daily routines and family generations. Additionally, it can signify a return to past significant places or relationships, or the feeling of being stuck in a vicious circle. \n \n In Tibetan Buddhist paintings, the Wheel is divided into six slices representing different forms of life and is known as Samsara, the wheel of existence. According to Buddhist belief, every creature is reborn time and again, moving up or down in the wheel based on their actions in previous lives. The ideal situation is to reach enlightenment or Nirvana, where the up and down movement in the wheel ceases. \n \n The Wheel card may encourage one to find a fixed point of tranquility within themselves that does not fluctuate with mood changes. This may involve spiritual exercises such as meditation and giving up desires.",

  force: {
    name: "The Force",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/fd15wJj/a11.jpg",
    description:
      "Throughout history, fighting a lion has symbolized bravery and strength. Examples of lion fights can be found in the Bible with characters like Samson and David, as well as in Greek mythology with Hercules. Additionally, the story of the nymph Cyrene tells of a woman who fought and killed a lion to protect her father's sheep, earning the attention and admiration of the god Apollo. In India, a female goddess named Durga or Kali is often depicted riding a lion or tiger as a symbol of power and strength. \n \n The Force card also represents strength but in a gentler way. Instead of a dominant and forceful figure like The Emperor, The Force depicts a woman holding a lion's mouth in a gentle manner. This could represent taming and mastering through collaboration, rather than through a violent struggle. The card signifies self-confidence and personal strength without resorting to violence or oppression. However, it is clear that the woman is in control, taming the lion rather than the other way around. If the querent is in a position of power, the card indicates that their authority is respected and there is no need for excessive force. Alternatively, if the querent is in a weaker position, the card may suggest cooperation rather than rebellion. \n \n The image of the woman and lion facing the same direction suggests self-control and taming one's own wild impulses. The woman's head, topped with a wide hat and crown, represents intellect guiding the hands and controlling animal desires. The tightly-laced bodice covering her chest may indicate the necessary detachment to control emotions and desires, but could also suggest losing touch with one's feelings. \n \n The lion is a recurring symbol in The World and The Force cards, representing desire and creative impulses. In The Force card, the lion appears to be growing out of the woman's pelvis, suggesting sexual or creative energy. The lion's open mouth is often associated with the female sexual organ, while its sharp teeth symbolize the male fear of female sexuality. The woman and lion's lines of gaze meet at a point to the right of the card, representing a convergence towards a future goal. The woman's hat spikes resemble the lion's teeth, suggesting a transformation of fierce passions into strength. Overall, the collaboration between different parts of the figure's being represents the summoning of internal resources to overcome challenges. \n \n In this tarot card, a woman delicately holds a lion's mouth with her fingertips. It's unclear whether she's trying to open it, close it, or simply keep it under control. This can be interpreted as a way to maintain the expression of desires while still exercising control. The lion symbolizes creative urges, and the card represents an attempt at controlled creative expression. \n \n However, holding a lion's mouth, even if it's under control, requires constant attention and alertness. The lion's look may seem devious, as if it's waiting for the right moment to break free and bite. The finger inside the open mouth shows a willingness to play with danger. This card can represent courage and daring, but also rashness and careless risk-taking. It may also represent a threat or inner conflict, currently held under control at great tension. \n \n The card's bottom and right side show very little ground, with parallel lines in the title strip giving it a dark aspect. This represents the deep layers of the soul, where passions originate beyond rational control. The woman's foot appears to have six toes, indicating an attempt to hold onto the ground firmly. This impulse may be due to feeling on the edge of the abyss, or it may be that the wild lion of passions connects the figure to a basic source of vitality that exists beneath detached intellect and blocked emotionality.",

  "hanged-man": {
    name: "The Hanged Man",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/JkGvfYz/a12.jpg",
    description:
      "Historically, hanging a person upside-down was a form of torture that combined pain and humiliation, often used on those with non-orthodox beliefs. Christians in the Roman Empire and Jews and Muslims in medieval Spain were subjected to this punishment. However, in the hanged man's perspective, everything appears upside-down, and suffering for one's faith is seen as an honor. Many writers have drawn connections between this card and Jesus on the cross or other sacrificed gods like Odin from Norse mythology. The card can also be interpreted as a bungee jump, which has roots in a rite of passage for native islanders in the Pacific Ocean. \n \n In some old Italian decks, this card is known as 'The Traitor,' potentially referencing Judas Iscariot, who hanged himself on a tree after betraying Christ, rather than Jesus himself. Therefore, a querent may receive punishment for an improper or unacceptable action they have taken. It could be inflicted by an external source, or the querent could chastise themselves for real or imagined faults. \n \n Although the traditional link between hanging and punishment may be disregarded, the hanged man is undoubtedly in an uncomfortable situation. The wooden frame encircles and isolates him from the surroundings and other people. The red tips of the cut branches signify sharpness and aggression, pointing outward (to others) and inward (to himself). The card can also describe a feeling that 'everything is upside-down,' meaning that one has lost their grasp on what is happening in their life. \n \n The mythological link to a god who sacrifices himself has led many authors to view the card as an expression of giving up one's personal interests for a higher cause. Some newer decks emphasize this interpretation with a calm expression and a halo of light around the head. Perhaps the querent accepts the process of undergoing difficulties or renouncing vital interests for someone else, for some political or ideological cause, or as part of some process of spiritual initiation. \n \n The hands of the hanged man may be tied behind his back or held there by choice, signifying a passive acceptance of whatever comes. The hanged posture and the surrounding wood frame give no space for maneuver. The 12 tips of the branches may symbolize a whole range of possibilities, like the full circle of the zodiac. Giving up all possible ways of action can lead to pain, as the red tips that look like blood drops indicate. This card may describe the querent's helpless and paralyzing state, or they may be reacting to a complex situation by giving up any action and accepting whatever happens, even if it turns out to be the inverse of what they expected. The card can thus indicate surrender and reconcilement with reality as it is. Alternatively, it can describe the emotional state of regarding oneself as a passive and helpless victim, either to avoid taking responsibility for one's situation or as a means for emotional extortion. \n \n The hanged man's position may seem distressful, but it is only a matter of perspective. As they are hanging upside down, their point of view is the opposite of the normal perspective. The card has no landscape except for the green ground on the sides, which can also resemble tree tops. This may hint that it is impossible to decide which is the correct point of view - the hanged man's or the accepted views held by people outside his frame. There is some similarity between this card (number 12) and the central figure in The World (21) in an inverse position. The card may describe a unique person who sees things in their way. It can also encourage the querent to think in original and nonconformist terms, which may be opposed to common logic. If an inverse card is beside the straight hanged man card, it may be that, from the special perspective of the querent, what is usually seen as a handicap or a crisis can look like an advantage or an opportunity. \n \n The Hanged Man represents acceptance of being different. When the card is inverted, it appears as though the figure has returned to a normal position with their head up. However, they still give off an odd impression of being enclosed and lacking stability. This can symbolize an individual's futile attempt to conform to societal norms and values at any cost. Conversely, when the card is upright with the head pointing down, it represents an acceptance of one's differences and a recognition that standard solutions may not apply to them. Rather than trying to force themselves into a mold, they embrace their unique qualities and strive to make the best of them. \n \n The Hanged Man also represents a deep examination of oneself. The earthly reality is blocked on both sides, leaving only a hole in the ground to move forward through. This can indicate that the only way to progress is through introspection and self-reflection. It may also represent a search for knowledge or a deeper understanding of a situation. \n \n Symbolically, hanging with the head down means letting go of previous assumptions and traditional distinctions between up and down. Unlike The Hermit, who seeks truth while holding onto their existing beliefs, The Hanged Man is willing to question everything. The uncomfortable position and isolating frame suggest that the individual is willing to endure personal difficulties and social reclusion in pursuit of transformation. This can be seen as a test or initiation preparing the individual for the experiences to come in the following cards, similar to a bungee jump.",

  death: {

    description:
      "Card 13 in new decks is known as 'Death', but in traditional decks, it has no name. The skeletal figure holding a scythe is commonly known as 'the grim reaper', although it does not represent the medieval Angel of Death. Rather, it represents some personification of death. The scythe appeared in the hand of the Greek titan Cronus, who represented both time and harvest, and was the king of the Elysian islands of the blessed dead. In Greek and Roman cultures, a skeleton symbolizing inevitable death carried a hedonistic message: 'Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we shall die.' In the Christian Middle Ages, a skeleton was used to convey the opposite message: earthly life is ephemeral, so we should better prepare ourselves for eternal life in the afterworld. \n \n Card 13 suggests the idea of death cutting and terminating life, with its skeletal image, the big blade of the scythe, the scattered body parts, and the overall dark appearance of the card. The card may represent the end of something, such as a chapter in life, cutting off a relationship, moving away to start a new life elsewhere, resigning, or being fired from a job. The sharp and decisive character of the card indicates an abrupt termination rather than a gradual decline. It also gives a feeling of inevitability. The pair of male and female heads on the ground, one of them crowned, can represent the parents or other figures of authority who were significant for the querent. \n \n The card can also represent coping with change, as any meaningful change in life always involves an emotional crisis. Even when it is a positive change, it is still a move away from the known and the secure toward a new and scary domain of uncertainty. The gloomy appearance of the card can be unsettling for a querent who is new to Tarot cards, but if Card 13 appears in the reading, it would be better to refer to it right away and clarify that it is about change and not necessarily about death. For a person wishing to disengage from past patterns and start something new, Card 13 is a good sign. \n \n Card 13 highlights the essential, as it is the first card in the suit showing a completely naked figure, but in an extreme and blatant way, 'naked to the bone.' The skeleton, which remains when other parts of the body have decayed, is a constant and stable element. The card may describe a shock or a crisis which exposes the true nature of things. It can also symbolize maintaining the essential and giving up the superficial. For example, it can be a financially difficult period which makes it necessary to relinquish luxuries and superficial pleasures. The hardy skeleton may also be a sort of 'moral backbone' which reveals itself in a time of crisis. \n \n Card 13 serves as a reminder of the inevitability of death, which can give us a better understanding of what truly matters in life. This concept has been expressed in various cultures throughout history, such as the ancient Romans shouting 'memento mori' during parades. The image on the card, featuring a crowned head at the bottom, symbolizes that everyone is equal in the face of death. However, the illustration also shows movement and dynamism, with the skeleton facing towards the future and the scythe's blade curving upwards. This suggests that while Card 13 may represent the end of old structures and loss, it also presents the opportunity for new beginnings and growth. Overall, Card 13 encourages a balanced and mature perspective on reality, helping us distinguish between what is truly important and what is not.",

  temperance: {
    name: "Temperance",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/XCjCKSm/a14.jpg",
    description:
      "The term 'temperance' originates from Latin and refers to the act of blending or mixing liquids. In particular, it is often used to describe the practice of adding water to wine. As a figure of speech, it represents a moderate and balanced approach without going to extremes. It has become one of Christianity's four main virtues. The French expression 'to temper one's wine with water' originally meant to calm down after getting angry, but today it is used to describe people who make concessions about their principles, either positively or negatively. During Catholic mass, water is mixed with wine to symbolize the dual nature of Christ as both human and divine. In the Middle Ages, depictions of the miracle of Cana often showed a figure pouring liquids from one vessel to another. \n \n The Temperance card represents finding a middle ground by combining two opposing qualities. The figure in the illustration expresses this balance in various ways, such as the combination of opposite colors in their dress, their wings suggesting both flight and groundedness, and their body leaning to both sides. The original meaning of Temperance as a virtue was to find balance and avoid being swept to either extreme. This idea is similar to the 'golden mean' advocated by Aristotle in ancient Greece. Later interpretations of Temperance were linked to moderation and restraint in fulfilling desires, particularly in regards to alcohol consumption. However, this eventually evolved into complete abstinence, which is different from the original meaning. \n \n The Temperance card can represent compromise, reconciliation, or finding a middle ground in conflicts. It may also indicate a mediator or a solution that combines the benefits of two options. The card can also represent moderate behavior without going to extremes. In comparison to the Justice card, which shows forceful domination, and The Force card, which shows a gentler approach, Temperance unites opposing forces through the flow of liquid. \n \n The act of pouring liquid back and forth in the Temperance card appears effortless and almost magical. This may suggest a skilled action that achieves something seemingly impossible or a compromise reached between seemingly incompatible parties. The card's serene atmosphere and patient movement may also represent patience, perseverance, and acceptance of inner conflicts and weaknesses in oneself and others. \n \n The stripe of liquid flowing before the figure's abdomen in the Temperance card may represent an inner flow, rather than an external one. This concept relates to traditional medicine's belief in life processes as a flow between opposite elements. For instance, medieval western medicine spoke of four liquids in the body, and the wellness of body and soul depended on their correct and balanced mixing. Similarly, in Chinese medicine, the energy of life (Chi) flows between the active element (Yang) and the passive element (Yin), which represents wellness. The Temperance card may refer to alternative, holistic medicine, natural methods of body and mind therapy, healthy nutrition, or a well-tempered lifestyle, such as Indian Yoga or Chinese Tai Chi. \n \n The Temperance card has also been linked to spiritual alchemy, which interprets alchemical writings as an allegory of personal transformation from rough matter (normal state of consciousness) to the philosopher's stone (pure and enlightened consciousness). The figure generating the flow across her middle in the card may be engaged in a process of self-distillation. The angel's wings and flower on her forehead may symbolize superior and benevolent intelligence, indicating that the distillation is driven by a pure and spiritual element in her being. \n \n However, the flow in the card is directed only inwards, and the immobile figure rooted in the ground expresses a lack of actual movement. The raised elbows may indicate excessive preoccupation with oneself and one's inner processes, leaving no place for practical advancement or close contact with others.",

  devil: {
    name: "The Devil",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/J2CpCYV/a15.jpg",
    description:
      "Le Diable, in French, can be understood as the Christian Devil, symbolizing absolute evil. However, it can also represent a mischievous and unruly demon or imp that is not entirely malevolent. While newer English decks depict a frightening demon, the figures in the Tarot de Marseille are depicted with a smile, appearing more bawdy and shameless than evil. The animal-like feet and horns resemble medieval descriptions of the Devil in popular beliefs and witch-hunter's manuals, but they may also relate to Pan, the Greek god of shepherds, symbolizing the wild forces of natural passion. The image closely resembles an ancient Babylonian tablet known as the 'Burney Relief,' currently housed in the British Museum and believed to depict Ereshkigal, queen of the underworld. \n \n The Devil card challenges conventional logic. Sometimes, it is associated with The Pope card due to a similar composition of one large figure and two smaller ones. However, the upper part of the Devil card can also be seen as a distorted mirror image of the Justice card. While The Pope and Justice represent socially established and accepted values, the Devil represents their opposite. The protruding tongue, reminiscent of the male sexual organ at the center of the card, symbolizes mockery and defiance of social conventions and norms. The large figure embodies contradictions, featuring a human body with animal elements and a male sexual organ with female breasts. \n \n The Devil can represent anarchism, subversion, and defiance of conventional norms. It also signifies inner paradoxes and contradictions that transcend traditional logic and binary classifications of good and evil, male and female, or human and animal. It may express behavior that pushes the boundaries of respectability and acceptance. For instance, it can represent an audacious display of a libertine or licentious lifestyle, a desire to experience forbidden things, or original and unconventional thinking that challenges societal norms. \n \n The Devil card symbolizes impulse and passion. Nudity appears in many major arcana cards, but it is only in the Devil card, with the exposed sexual organ at its center, that it explicitly refers to sexuality. The card's overtly lustful nature suggests an unrestrained expression of desires. The two little devils or imps, one male and the other female, may represent passionate partners engaged in a stormy liaison. Their animal features and their gaze directed at the tip of the main figure's penis convey a relationship centered around sex and impulsive desire. The ropes tied to their necks symbolize difficulty in breaking free. Moreover, the card can represent any non-rational behavior driven by desires and passions. \n \n One can interpret the bondage and the object wielded like a whip as indicators of sexual domination or experiences within the realm of sadomasochism. It is unclear whether the penis and breasts depicted are genuine or merely artificial accessories worn to convey that everything is exposed but should not be taken at face value. The card can thus express fantasy, imagination, and inventiveness in sexual matters. Returning to the symbolic link between desire and creativity, it can also represent a creative impulse breaking free from conventional limits. \n \n The Devil card emerges from the abyss. The black area at the bottom of the card represents the abyss, which is also present in other cards. It can be interpreted as the deep layers of dark feelings, past traumas, fear, and pain. The card's upward movement signifies forces originating from the hidden depths of the soul and manifesting in the open. The Devil's wild and impulsive behavior may be an expression of an underlying personality disorder or a plea for help in a state of emotional distress. The card can also symbolize the influence of dark impulses such as anger and aggression, representing the release of 'the devil within you.' This upward movement also holds an enlightened aspect. The two little imps resemble plant",

  tower: {
    name: "The Tower",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/2tMDtdR/a16.jpg",
    description:
      "The tower symbolizes power and dominance from a masculine perspective. When struck by lightning, it represents the blow to one's pride. Some authors associate the card with the Tower of Babel, where the builders were punished for their futile attempt to reach Heaven. The three windows, the crown atop the tower, and the lightning may allude to the story of St. Barbara, a pagan king's daughter. In her determination to convert to Christianity, she carved a third window in the tower as a symbol of the Holy Trinity. Her enraged father had her executed, but he was then struck dead by lightning. The colored circles in the air are unrelated to this story and resemble medieval depictions of the Manna that descended upon the Israelites during their desert journey. \n \n The Tower represents the collapse of solid structures. The image portrays a tower struck by lightning, with figures seemingly falling to the ground. This signifies a sudden and destructive blow to a previously stable construction. The card can indicate the abrupt breakdown of relationships or partnerships, as suggested by the positions of the falling figures moving in separate directions. It may also signify the loss of a position in the workplace, the crumbling of beliefs and opinions, or an economic and political crisis. Even those in positions of power and authority, represented by the crown on the tower, are not immune to downfall. \n \n The disintegration of solid structures can also have positive connotations. The stone walls of the tower may have confined the querent, and their collapse can symbolize liberation from confinement. This liberation can involve the removal of external barriers or an inner emancipation from limiting ideas that paralyze personal growth. \n \n The Tower represents an opening to the divine. The literal translation of the French card title is 'The House God,' suggesting a temple-like structure rather than a defiant act against heaven. Temples have a spiritual significance as material structures that receive heavenly grace. This may explain the colorful shape emerging from the circular object at the top right corner, symbolizing divine energy entering the tower from above. \n \n The Tower card can represent a miraculous or sudden divine intervention in earthly matters. The flesh-colored tower can also symbolize the physical body, with the crowned top representing the head. In this interpretation, the human being becomes a living temple that receives influences or messages from higher realms, akin to a divine trance or prophecy. In a broader sense, the card can signify a moment of revelation or insight, where an idea strikes like a lightning flash, dramatically altering one's perspective. \n \n The opening at the top of the tower, allowing the penetration of energy, can be seen as a symbol of feminine sexuality, while the masculine tower with flying circles suggests a male orgasm. The two shorter windows and the elongated third window also resemble male genitalia. As such, the card can signify a passionate sexual union or a state of ecstasy that transcends ordinary reality. \n \n The Tower is built gradually and collapses swiftly. The tower is constructed layer by layer with bricks. If we view it as a temple, the lightning strike of divine grace isn't an unforeseen catastrophe but rather the moment when the purpose of the building is realized. The card represents a continuous process reaching a critical point where everything suddenly moves. For example, it can denote the sudden realization of a project after long and arduous preparations. In a negative sense, it may indicate tension accumulating until it erupts, like hidden resentment leading to an open quarrel. In any case, the stormy nature of the card signifies intense and dramatic events. \n \n The Tower suspends the laws of reality. It's uncertain whether the figures in the card are actually falling from the tower. The figure on the right might be crawling from behind the tower, and the one on the left could be hovering in the air with hands barely touching the ground. This temporary suspension of gravity, or the ordinary laws of reality, implies a critical realization that changes everything. Even if anticipated or planned, the moment of realization is often shocking and creates a sense of fantastic reality where anything seems possible. \n \n The card may describe a period of personal upheaval where the querent questions the boundaries of reality. They may face difficulties in adapting and feel as though everything is upside-down. However, this can also present new and promising possibilities that don't exist in normal circumstances. In other words, one can seize the moment when old rules crumble and turn a crisis into an opportunity. \n \n The Tower returns to the ground. The tower is an artificial structure that ascends, while the figures in the card appear to be returning to the ground. Their outstretched hands seem as if they are about to touch the plants. Alternatively, if the colorful circles represent Manna, their hands may be collecting fallen pieces from the ground. This perspective views the high-rise tower as symbolizing grandiose fantasies and unrealistic plans. The figures, however, are returning to the stable ground of reality with modest yet productive goals and aspirations. The card encourages the querent to focus on realistic, small-scale objectives rather than far-reaching but uncertain plans. It also suggests a return to a modest and respectable way of living within one's means, without excessive luxury.",

  star: {
    name: "The Star",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/545BnTk/a17.jpg",
    description:
      "The Star is the first of three cards with a similar structure, featuring a celestial object in the upper part and a dreamlike scene in the lower part. The prominent star resembles a compass rose found on old maps and may also represent the Pole Star, around which all other celestial objects revolve. Some interpretations identify the seven smaller stars as the Pleiades group from Greek mythology. According to the myth, the Pleiades were seven nymph sisters who were transformed into stars by Zeus to save them from the pursuit of the hunter Orion. This transformation occurred as they flew upward to the heavens. The presence of a nude figure in the card combines themes of cleanliness and vulnerability, often associated with mythological stories of someone falling in love with a goddess or a woman bathing in the nude. \n \n The Star symbolizes the mystical union of the sun, the moon, and a star, which is a common combination of symbols in Renaissance alchemy. In alchemical emblems, these elements are depicted in a manner similar to the cards. The sun represents the masculine principle, the moon represents the feminine principle, and the star represents the mystical union between them. This combination also reflects medieval cosmology, where celestial objects were associated with crystal-like spheres nested within one another. The sphere of the moon was closest to Earth, followed by the sphere of the sun, and finally, the sphere of the fixed stars, which was closest to the divine realm. \n \n The tranquil and flowing nature of the card illustration, along with the symbolic representation of the star as pure and sublime, has led many authors to associate The Star card with images of nature fantasy, such as the garden of Eden or the fountain of youth. The nude figure in the card is seen as a symbol of honesty and truth, representing a state of revealing everything without hiding anything. Despite physical distortions in the lower part of the figure in the Tarot de Marseille, it still conveys a sense of readiness to accept things as they are, with all their weaknesses and flaws. The openness in the card also signifies innocence and pure intentions. \n \n Bathing or pouring water on oneself is considered a symbolic act of self-cleansing and spiritual purification in both Western and Eastern religions. The figure in the card is depicted washing the lower part of her body, symbolizing purification from feelings of sin and guilt associated with the body and sexuality. The card's representation of a naked figure in an open landscape signifies a renouncement of artificial and sophisticated structures, embracing simplicity and the natural world. It can represent a moment of withdrawal from the fast pace of modern life or a personal ritual that brings a sense of self-purification and cleansing from negative influences. It may also represent experiences of physical or emotional vulnerability. \n \n The Star card reflects the removal of limits and boundaries, not only through the symbolism of nudity but also through the blending of details within the illustration. The flowing water from the vessel blends with the woman's thigh, and the landscape details blend with the vessel, creating a complex and strange shape. The card signifies a softening of rigid limits and separations, allowing for a sense of flow and adaptation. However, while the limits become flexible, they are not completely lost. The presence of the Pole Star above the figure's head suggests that she maintains her focal point, even though she is not directly looking at it. This indicates that she is intuitively doing the right thing based on her instincts. \n \n The card also conveys the idea of generosity and giving. The freely flowing liquid from the vessels represents a willingness to share with others. This can be seen as a positive trait of generosity or as wastefulness and squandering. The presence of a bird on the tree, possibly a dove silhouette, may allude to the story of the Pleiades fleeing from their pursuer, signifying uncertainty and danger. In this aspect, the querent may feel exposed and defenseless in the face of a threat. \n \n From a mystical perspective, the large star symbolizes divine or cosmic consciousness, while the smaller stars represent its reflections in individual minds. The small star above the figure's head represents her own 'higher self,' an intermediate level between her personal identity and cosmic consciousness. The card suggests the flow of cosmic energies into earthly reality, such as in spiritual therapies like Reiki, healing practices, or channeling messages from higher beings. \n \n The rounded abdomen of the figure may symbolize pregnancy and the willingness to take risks by exposing oneself reflects optimism. The main star also evokes the Star of Bethlehem, which announced the birth of the Christian savior, or a sense of being protected from above. The card can be interpreted as a message of hope, encouraging the querent to let things unfold naturally and expect positive outcomes. The card can also be connected to the Hebrew word 'mazal,' meaning luck, which refers to both stars and flowing elements, aligning with the card's depiction. In this sense, the card signifies luck or blessings from a higher source.",

  moon: {
    name: "The Moon",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/9VMdK38/a18.jpg",
    description:
      "The moon image on the card represents the female principle of absorption and containment, based on alchemical symbolism. It is often linked to the idea of a repeating cycle and matters related to water. In astrology, the moon rules the sign of Cancer, associated with the element of water and representing the womb, motherhood, and home. The moon's orbit is seen as a border zone between the earthly domain and heavenly spheres in medieval cosmology. However, in popular belief, full-moon nights are often related to rites of sorcery and to 'lunatic' behavior.  \n \n The Moon card features a moonlit landscape that creates a mysterious, enchanted, and unsettling atmosphere. The animal figures and strange buildings hint towards the nocturnal reality of dreams where deep and strange contents rise and flood the mind. The animals, floating drops, and even the ground between the dogs seem to be attracted upwards, expressing the quality of attraction ascribed to the moon in alchemical symbolism. One cannot truly touch the moon, and the sharp rays suggest that it is better not to try. The card may express a feeling of longing for something beyond normal reality, an attraction to a dangerous ideal, or a person who is emotionally unreachable. \n \n The Moon card can also represent an altered perception of reality such as in dreams or with psychedelic drugs. It can awaken hidden forces and describe the awakening of vague but strong emotions or actions motivated by deep feelings rather than rational considerations. The card may also describe underlying factors hidden from 'daylight' perception, such as a hidden danger or a quarrel whose real motives are different from what is seen on the surface. \n \n The Moon card symbolizes the past, with the left side appearing more dominant than the right side. The moon's face is turned to the left, and the left dog is in a higher position with its tail raised, while the right dog's tail is drooping. The left tower looks open and lit up, while the right tower looks closed and shaded. The card can describe past influences emerging and impacting the present, often stemming from the distant past. It may also be related to past life incarnations, previous generations in the family, or the influence of distant historical events. The card may indicate a need to take a step back in order to move forward later on. \n \n In tarot, the Moon card can represent a difficult struggle with emerging emotions or problems. However, the card's advanced position in the suit suggests that the querent has the maturity and personal resources to handle it. The movement in the card is upward, indicating a potential for personal growth and new insight. The card encourages the querent to look deeper into complex situations and not settle for superficial solutions. \n \n While the card can also represent emotional decline or depression, there is a solid foundation beneath the surface. The card urges the querent not to repress dark feelings and to trust in their inner strength. The lower edge of the card shows a change from barren rocks to fertile ground, representing the potential for growth and hidden treasures. \n \n The Moon's symbolic link to cycles and tides suggests that present hardships are temporary and will lead to personal growth. The narrow passage of rocks reminds us to not be afraid and to have faith in ourselves.",

  sun: {
    name: "The Sun",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/4MshM0P/a19.jpg",
    description:
      "The sun occupies a central role among celestial bodies, both in medieval astronomy, where its apparent motion serves as the foundation for all celestial movements, and in modern astronomy, as the central force around which planets orbit. In alchemical symbolism, the sun represents masculinity and fatherhood, radiating light and warmth. During the era of absolute monarchy in France, the sun was seen as a symbol of the king, representing his grace bestowed upon his subjects. In astrology, the sun is associated with the zodiac sign Leo, considered the ruler of royalty. The two children depicted in the card often represent twins found in various myths across different cultures. They can be direct descendants of the gods or the sun god, symbolizing heroes who fight for the forces of light. In Indian mythology, they are known as the Ashvin twins and possess healing powers. \n \n The Sun card symbolizes light and warmth. The vibrant and cheerful colors, along with the interaction between the children, imbue the card with optimism. The sun's rays are depicted as smooth and expanding, almost touching the children's heads. This contrasts with the contracted and prickly shape of the Moon card. Like the life-giving sunlight, the card represents abundance and blessings from above. It may signify the positive influence of individuals in positions of power, the influx of healing energy, or the assistance of higher forces, whether natural or supernatural. In practical matters, it can indicate a comfortable situation, prosperity, and success. \n \n The Sun card creates a space for the child within. The two figures can represent children or evoke a sense of childhood. The sunlit area, partially enclosed, can be seen as a playground for children. In this context, the Sun card may relate to the querent's own children (not necessarily two), childhood experiences, or children in general. It can also symbolize childlike qualities or the expression of one's inner childâ€”playfulness, creativity, and imagination. Alternatively, the card can signify impulsiveness, impatience, innocence, naivety, sincerity, spontaneity, curiosity, fresh perspectives, or a capacity for learning and adaptation. It may also suggest participation in New Age workshops or similar activities that encourage the expression of childlike aspects of one's personality. \n \n The card can also indicate a reluctance to grow up and take on adult responsibilities. For example, it may represent a person overly dependent on their parents or reliant on external help and support. It can depict living in a 'fool's paradise,' avoiding the challenges of real life. According to Jodorowsky, the Sun can be interpreted as an idealized father figure, such as a father who was absent during childhood, resulting in a sense of his presence being distant and intangible. It can also signify a persistent feeling of being watched and monitored from above. \n \n The Sun card embodies both exposure and limits. The children are almost naked, yet they wear loin cloths. There is a low wall behind them, which can be easily surmounted. The card conveys a moderate level of openness that maintains boundaries while allowing for personal connection. For instance, it may represent a friendship without sexual involvement or a close relationship that still preserves some personal space. It can also signify an educational approach or management style that emphasizes setting boundaries with a humane touch. \n \n The Sun card emphasizes the bond between partners. Many authors interpret the two children as twins, even though they are not identical. They can be seen as brothers, whether in a biological or metaphorical sense. The warm contact between them, with a hug and a touch near the heart, conveys a sense of brotherhood. The sunlight and nudity suggest transparency and the absence of hidden agendas or ill intentions. The protected space fosters intimacy and security. \n \n The card may symbolize warmth and mutual trust between siblings, partners, or friends. It can indicate the need to find a suitable partner for a collaborative project. The card may also represent the discovery of a 'twin soul' who provides emotional support. On a negative note, the childlike figures and the loin cloth can suggest sexual inhibitions within a romantic relationship. \n \n The Sun card represents finding a path. The figure on the left appears to have remnants of a tail, hinting at an animalistic and undeveloped nature. The groping hands indicate a search for direction. The figure on the right displays a more focused and alert demeanor, guiding and leading the other. A white surface beneath their feet, similar to The Magician card, symbolizes an open future. The Sun card may signify someone who offers support and guidance to the querent, leading them in a positive direction. This guidance comes from an equal standpoint, rather than a position of authority like The Pope. \n \n The tail and collar rings also bear resemblance to features found on the two imps in The Devil card. It could represent a more enlightened phase in a relationship between two individuals. Alternatively, the figures may represent different aspects of the querent's personality. Carl Gustav Jung introduced the concept of the 'shadow personality,' representing the dark aspects of the subconscious mind. Initially, we tend to reject and deny these parts, but in the Sun card, we see the more developed side accepting and integrating the shadow, guiding it towards the light.",

  judgment: {
    name: "Judgment",
    image: "https://i.ibb.co/8zgW7qp/a20.jpg",
    description:
      "The image on the card is inspired by the Christian concept of the last judgement, which is based on St. John's vision in the Book of Revelation. In this vision, seven angels sound their trumpets and announce global catastrophes. Following a series of extraordinary events, the dead are resurrected and face their final judgement, leading to the unity of heaven and earth. While images of the last judgement often focus on its terrible aspects and the fate of those condemned to hell, the Judgement card appears lively, optimistic, and illuminated. It may refer to the resurrection of the dead, but the symbols of judgement (sword and scales) are usually associated with the Justice card, not this one. Jodorowsky interprets the name of the card, 'le juge ment', as 'the judge lies', suggesting that all judgements are false. \n \n The Book of Revelation is originally called Apocalypse, which means 'lifting of the veil' or 'revelation' in Greek. The Christian day of judgement marks the end of worldly history and the manifestation of heaven on earth. There is a connection between this idea and the two final cards of the major suit: the Judgement card refers to the apocalyptic events, while The World represents a divine vision of reality. The World card is more symmetrical, stable, and may indicate the end of a process or a state of equilibrium. In contrast, the Judgement card is dramatic and dynamic, directing movement mainly along the vertical axis. It may represent the completion of inner processes, such as spiritual or emotional quests, and open us to a new experience of life. \n \n The Judgement card can signify a moment of revelation, an awakening, or a new understanding. It may represent a significant turning point in a therapy process, a personal transformation, or some form of enlightenment or spiritual awakening. The dramatic nature of the card suggests a quick pace of events and a special moment rather than an ongoing process. It can also indicate significant insights obtained from a reading. \n \n The cross on the flag may have Christian connotations, but it is an ancient symbol that predates Christianity. It can represent the meeting of the two axes in the cards: the horizontal axis of earthly reality and the vertical axis of inner experience. The trumpet can be seen as a path to the sky above and the line pattern on the back of the middle figure imitates the trumpet shape, indicating active acceptance of what comes from above. The tonsured head suggests the figure has undergone a path of spiritual learning, and the hill behind it may resemble an eye observing us, symbolizing higher wisdom. The card may describe a moment of grace in which spiritual reality manifests itself on the earthly plane, such as the peak of a magical ritual or a mystical experience that blurs the line between ordinary and extraordinary reality. It can indicate an awakening to a higher level of consciousness or the understanding that there is something beyond material existence. It may also signify a moment in which the gates of heaven open, allowing us to make a wish that will come true. \n \n This card depicts three figures on the ground, possibly a child with two parents. It can represent an ideal family dynamic where the parents are loving and supportive towards their child. The nudity depicted in the card signifies an equal and respectful attitude towards both child and adult. This card can also indicate the querent taking on the responsibility of being a parent. However, if the card is reversed, it may suggest an unhealthy relationship between parents and child. \n \n The opening in the ground represents the previously mentioned abyss, which is now illuminated and open to the sky. The white surfaces around the pelvis symbolize purity in sexual matters. The angel with raised wings and extended tongue represents the elevated version of the main figure from The Devil card. This card may signify some sort of redemption or emotional healing for the querent. The connection between the angel and the central figure may represent an encounter with the querent's personal angel, a benevolent and sublime part of themselves. \n \n This card also signifies the revealing of hidden secrets and the exposure of private matters. The trumpet indicates that this information may become public knowledge, leading to either fame or defamation. This card can also symbolize the birth of something new, such as a new baby in the family or a personal transformation opening a new chapter in the querent's life.",

      "The 'Christ in Majesty' artwork from the medieval era features a pointed oval aureole called mandorla, which resembles the wreath of leaves in the card. The artwork also depicts the four living creatures mentioned in the books of Ezekiel and Revelation - a bull, a lion, a man, and an eagle - known as tetramorph in Christian tradition. The central figure of the artwork resembles the mystic Hildegard von Bingen's 12th-century illustration of 'cosmic man' surrounded by a circular halo and the four wings of the cardinal directions. The card also resembles the south Indian depictions of the god Shiva Nataraj. The concept of cosmic man refers to the traditional mystical view of the human body and soul as a miniature image of the universe.  \n \n The World card represents a complete image of the universe, human beings, and the Tarot deck. It symbolizes a harmonious integration between different areas of activity and realization and success in practical matters. The World expresses an ideal vision of perfection, motivating the querent to move forward, evolve and find better solutions. It can also represent completion, signifying the end of a project or process. The card symbolizes the tension between two opposites, such as male and female, and may indicate a movement driven by this tension. It can signify the best course to draw benefits from both options. \n \n The World card depicts a dancing figure within a frame, surrounded by a wreath. The four creatures in the corners represent the fixed astrological signs, providing stability to the celestial wheel of the zodiac. Two triangular shapes at the top suggest a hidden star. The card represents movement within a stable framework, such as a person leading a conventional life while experiencing rich inner emotions. The dancing figure also resembles a depiction of David from the 9th century and the Hindu god Shiva, linking the card to dance and bodily expression.  \n \n The dancing figure is enclosed, protecting but also limiting it. The card may indicate feeling trapped in a situation that appears fine on the surface, such as a well-paid job with no room for advancement. The wreath symbolizes disconnection between inner feelings and external life situations. The navel of the figure represents the Greek concept of the world's navel, indicating emotional independence and self-sufficiency or narcissism and social isolation. \n \n As the final card of the suit, The World represents closure and preparation for something new. The illustration resembles a human embryo, suggesting hidden seeds of change within apparent stability. The hand touching the wreath on the right side expresses a desire to come out and be born, indicating preparation for a project or idea.",

      "The French word 'mat' means dull or not shiny, and it is sometimes referred to as 'le fou,' meaning 'the insane.' While this may seem like an unflattering title, various spiritual traditions link madness with sanctity and higher wisdom. For instance, in the Bible and Jewish Midrash tradition, 'prophet' and 'man of spirit' are often associated with 'madman' or 'fool.' Similarly, Daoist and Zen philosophies in China and Japan depict an ideal sage behaving like a mindless madman. Many authors saw The Fool as a symbol of sublime spirituality, and in the Golden Dawn system, it represents the highest degree of consciousness. \n \n The illustrated figure on The Fool card may remind us of a classic 'village fool' being chased by dogs. The natural landscape suggests that he is outside the structures and accepted norms of society. While one can understand the image of the fool literally, meaning that the person asking the question is acting foolishly and risks making themselves a laughingstock, we can also view the card as an expression of total freedom from the laws of reason, worldly obligations, and caring about others' opinions. The figure of the fool who seems not to care where he's going represents uncertainty and an open future, and his progression towards the right represents advancement. \n \n The Fool card can indicate freedom from bonds and attachment to fixed frameworks. For example, it can symbolize a period of aimlessly roaming about without a clear goal, a long journey, or an attitude of non-commitment that leaves all options open. However, in a less positive sense, the card can represent a person who has difficulties in choosing and committing themselves, such as to a fixed place of residence, a relationship, or a professional activity. One might also consider that the lower end of his staff is stuck in the ground, so he is going round in circles. \n \n In new English decks, The Fool is often depicted walking carefree along the edge of a cliff. This can indicate a lack of responsibility in a dangerous situation, or 'fool's luck' that protects him from harm. The Fool card has no number, leading some authors to suggest that it isn't really a part of the major suit. However, the number band at the top still gives it a typical major suit structure. Perhaps like the village fool who is part of society but also an outcast, The Fool both belongs and doesn't belong to the major suit. The card can indicate a maverick or 'odd bird,' someone (or something) that is unusual, deviant, and impossible to classify. It can also encourage the person asking the question to free themselves from conventional patterns and look for uncommon solutions 'outside the box.' \n \n The Fool gives up control, as symbolized by the yellow hem, belt, and rod separating The Fool's figure into legs, pelvis, chest, and head, symbolizing the four domains of earthly activity. The man's upward gaze gives the impression that he's not paying attention to the road, and the exposed buttock scratched by the animal may symbolize a weakness or vulnerable point of which the person asking the question is oblivious. Being on the left, the animal may also be something from the past disturbing the querent, haunting or prodding them to move forward. We can interpret the card as a lack of organization, chaos, and carelessness. However, in a situation of uncertainty, it may be better to adopt the fool's attitude: give up control, embrace spontaneity, refrain from too much planning, and adapt oneself to changing circumstances. \n \n The three sections of the rod resting on The Fool's shoulders may represent past, present, and future. The sack hanging from its end can symbolize the heavy burden of past memories, assets, and tools acquired through experience. The Fool carries their past along with them, so that at any moment, they can reinterpret and give it a new meaning. The receptive spoon-shaped rear end of the rod may indicate readiness to add new insights to old ones. The white front tip may express an undetermined future, but the hand touching it indicates that the fool's actions are shaping and directing it. \n \n The philosophies of Dao and Zen share a common recommendation to focus on the present without worrying about the past or future. Both also refer to the concept of emptiness, which can be likened to a missing card number. The Chinese word 'dao' means 'way', evoking the image of a walking figure like that seen on the Fool card. The Fool card represents someone who lives in the moment and pays attention only to the present. If it is the last card in a spread, it can signify an unknown outcome that is yet to be determined. \n \n In traditional Tarot games, every card had a fixed value except for the Fool, which could replace any other card. In ordinary card games, a similar role is played by the Joker. Like the Fool, the Joker is often depicted as a clown with bells, a pointed hat, and a ball on its tip. The Fool card may represent someone who acts like a clown or joker, finding humor in any situation and not caring about others' opinions. Alternatively, it can be interpreted as a sign of adaptability and flexibility, such as someone who adjusts well to different situations or expresses different aspects of their personality in various contexts. \n \n Ultimately, the Fool can represent anyone on the path of life. It serves as a reminder that in the face of life's great mysteries, we are all mindless fools. In complicated situations that bring people to Tarot readings, the Fool's message may be simple but sobering: let go of big questions and sophisticated plans, stop worrying about the past and future, and just live in the present moment.",
