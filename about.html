            When people consider the magic and the symbolic power of the Tarot,
            which is responsible for its huge impact on many generations, they
            usually think about the 22 cards of the major suit. Without the
            major suit we would have a deck similar to the normal playing cards:
            a convenient means for games of chance and for popular
            fortune-telling, but not something which could motivate centuries of
            preservation, development, interpretation and creativity as the
            Tarot cards have done. <br /><br />

            The relationship between the major suit and the four minor suits can
            be seen symbolically in The World card, which is the last one of the
            major suit. In its corners there are four living creatures taken
            from Biblical tradition: bull, lion, human, and eagle. These can
            symbolize the four minor suits and the four domains of life which
            are body, desire, emotion and intellect. The four figures define a
            solid rectangular frame, which also brings to mind the regular
            structure of the four suits. The dynamic element appears in the
            middle, in the form of a naked figure dancing within an oblong
            wreath. In the Tarot deck, it can represent the major suit. In the
            human sphere it can symbolize consciousness, which unites the
            different functions into a single entity.

          <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl underline my-6">Order & Chaos</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The major suit differs from the minor suits not only in the richness
            and complexity of its card illustrations, but also in its less
            orderly and more chaotic structure. The four minor suits follow a
            fully predictable pattern. After the 4 of cups comes the 5 of cups,
            and just as there is a knight of swords, there is a knight of coins.
            In contrast, the cards in the major suit display a complex and
            unpredictable sequence. To demonstrate this point, let us consider a
            situation where someone sees all the cards from the beginning of the
            major suit up to a certain card. From this information, he would
            still have no way of guessing the title or the subject of the card
            which follows. <br /><br />
            This characteristic sets the major suit apart from other systems of
            symbolic illustrations which were common during the Renaissance. An
            interesting example is a collection of card-like prints from the
            later 15th century. They are known as Tarocchi del Mantegna (“The
            Tarot of Mantegna”), although they are not really Tarot cards and
            the attribution to the famous painter Mantegna is unfounded.
            <br /><br />
            The Mantegna prints are divided into five suits of ten images each,
            with symbolic subjects taken from the conceptual world of the
            Renaissance. The five suits represent themes like professions and
            social positions, liberal arts and sciences, the nine muses, moral
            virtues and celestial objects. Some of the subjects are similar to
            Tarot cards. For example, there is an Emperor, a Pope, and images
            representing Force, Justice, the Sun and the Moon. <br /><br />
            Still, the Mantegna prints are very different from the Tarot. First
            of all, it is not even clear that they were meant to be used as a
            deck of cards. In the surviving originals the images are printed on
            thin paper and bound together as a book, perhaps for educational
            purposes. This gives them a well-defined and single standard
            ordering. In contrast, Tarot cards can be arranged and read in any
            order. This means that there is an element of chaos which is
            inherent to the Tarot cards already by the fact that they exist as a
            set of separate images that can be freely arranged. <br /><br />
            The more orderly character of the Mantegna prints is further
            expressed in the regular structure of the five suits, none of which
            are exceptional in size or structure. All the illustrations are
            consecutively numbered, and each one of them has a title written at
            the bottom. Moreover, when sets of symbols are used they are
            presented in their completeness. For example, all the nine muses
            appear consecutively without any one missing, and the same is true
            of the seven traditional planets, the four cardinal virtues and so
            on.

            More patterns appear further along the line just to break down once
            again. Three major cards present, at equal intervals, three of the
            four cardinal virtues in Christian tradition: Justice (number 8),
            Force (11) and Temperance (14). But the fourth virtue, Prudence, is
            missing. The Temperance card presents another exception. It is the
            only card in the major suit whose French name is written without the
            definite article, “Temperance” and not “La Temperance.”

            Further along the suit there are three cards with astronomical and

            them we find The Tower, with a different symbolic language whose
            origin is unclear. And after these cards comes The Judgment card
            which is again linked to Christian symbolism.

            Many Tarot books over the last two centuries have tried to find a
            uniform and logical order in the major suit. Some of their authors
            have based their attempts on the ordering of the cards, for example
            by dividing the suit without The Fool into three sets of seven
            cards, or into seven sets of three cards. More complex patterns were
            also tried. None of them have proved convincing enough to gain
            general acceptance. <br /><br />
            Other authors have tried to find order in the cards by imposing a
            system of symbols taken from other sources. For example, many have
            tried to establish a correspondence between the major suit cards and
            the astrological symbols of planets and zodiac signs. But each have
            notably done so in a different way. The Golden Dawn order leaders
            tried to integrate the cards into their huge table of world-wide
            correspondences. But again, a disagreement soon appeared as to how
            exactly to do it. Apparently, in each of these schemes some cards
            naturally find their place. But then there are others which do not
            fit so easily, and finally there are some that really have to be
            forced into their corresponding slots. Some of the correspondences
            created over the years are interesting, and may enrich our
            understanding of the cards. One such example is the correspondence
            between the cards and Hebrew letters outlined later. But perhaps we
            should not attach too much importance to any orderly table or any
            scheme for the definite arrangement of the cards. The breaking of
            patterns in the major suit could itself carry an important message
            for us. <br /><br />
            Scientists today speak of the phenomena of life as emerging “on the
            edge of chaos,” a sort of intermediate region between chaos and
            order. The perfect order is expressed by a solid crystal where
            everything is well-ordered and fixed. It has no potential for
            movement, and thus no place for life. The total chaos is expressed
            by smoke which has no stable shape. Here too there can be no life,
            because every structure would quickly dissipate. Biological and
            social life processes take place somewhere in between the crystal
            and the smoke. They are characterized by a certain degree of order
            and stability, but also by creative unpredictability and an
            occasional collapse of ordered structures. <br /><br />
            The cards in the major suit, which express and reflect the infinite
            complexity of life, can also be thought of as a system on the edge
            of chaos. They show some degree of order and structure, but also
            chaotic irregularities and pattern-breaking. Therefore it might be
            pointless to look for an ultimate structure behind them. The only
            pattern in the cards is the cards themselves.

        <!-- Titles Numbers -->
        <div class="chapter p-container mt-10 mb-0 hidden">
          <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl underline my-6">Titles & Numbers</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            In the Tarot de Marseille, the number of each card appears in Roman
            numerals. The notation is a long one in which, for example, 9 is
            written as VIIII and not as IX. Perhaps this was done to prevent
            confusion when the cards were held upside down. In new decks of the
            English school the numbers are sometimes written in Roman numerals
            in short notation (i.e., 9 is IX) and sometimes in modern numerals.
            <br /><br />
            The numbers and titles of the major suit cards are basically the
            same in both schools, but there are two differences. The Golden Dawn
            leaders wanted to have more order and less chaos in the cards. For
            this reason they made the two exceptional cards in the Tarot de
            Marseille conform with the others. They gave the title “Death” to
            Card 13, and this title appears in many decks of the English school.
            They also put the number 0 on The Fool card, thus placing it at the
            beginning of the suit. There are also some decks in which The Fool
            is given the number 22 and placed at the end of the suit.
            <br /><br />
            Another difference between the two schools is in the numbering of
            the Justice and Force cards. In the Tarot de Marseille and in other
            traditional decks, Justice is number 8 and The Force is number 11.
            But in new decks from the English school, The Force is 8 and Justice
            is 11. The reason for this lies in the complex system of Golden Dawn
            correspondences. Putting Tarot cards, Cabbalistic texts and
            astrological signs together, the order leaders came up with a
            correspondence of the twelve signs to twelve cards arranged by their
            numbers. Writing it down, the Justice card was correlated with the
            sign of Leo (lion) and the Force card with the sign of Libra
            (scales). This, however, looks strange because scales appear in the
            Justice card, and a lion appears in The Force card. <br /><br />
            The Golden Dawn leaders believed that the original Tarot possessed a
            perfect order, and this anomaly reflects some mistake that crept in
            during the ages. To set it right they switched the two cards. In
            their system Justice became 11 with a correspondence to Libra, and
            The Force, which they renamed Strength, became 8 with a
            correspondence to Leo. This modified numbering became the standard
            for all new decks in the English school.

        <div class="chapter p-container mt-10 mb-0 hidden">
          <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl underline my-6">Ladder of Creation</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Why is it at all important to know the true ordering of the cards,
            if we can place them anyway in the order we wish? The answer is that
            both schools believed that the ordering of the cards was not
            arbitrary. Rather, there was some message or story that the suit
            sequence was meant to express. <br /><br />
            Many Tarot interpreters, in their quest to figure out this message,
            were influenced by Neo-Platonist philosophy. Neo-Platonism is a set
            of beliefs which appeared in the first centuries BCE, was later
            revived in the Renaissance, and also influenced the Jewish Cabbala.
            According to the Neo-Platonist view the world was created in a
            series of “emanations,” a ladder of consecutive steps in which the
            divine plenitude or light descends. The highest level is pure
            spirituality, and coming down from it the light gradually becomes
            tangible and concrete. Finally it reaches the earthly level, which
            is the everyday reality of matter and action. <br /><br />
            Some of the first French Tarot Cabbalists interpreted the card
            sequence of the major suit as an image of Neo-Platonic emanation.
            They considered The Magician (number 1) and the following cards as a
            representation of the highest spiritual level. Further on, they
            claimed, the sequence of cards descends in the scale of emanation,
            finally reaching the last card of the suit – The World (number 21)
            which represents material reality. <br /><br />
            The leaders of the Golden Dawn order further developed this idea.
            They arranged the cards in the form of a traditional Cabbalistic
            diagram, the Sefirot Tree which describes 10 aspects of the divine
            essence and 22 paths connecting them. They saw the highest spiritual
            degree in The Fool card, which they put at the beginning of the deck
            as number 0. Therefore, in their system it appears at the top of the
            tree. Then, going down the tree paths, they arranged all the other
            cards by their consecutive numbers, finally reaching The World at
            the bottom. <br /><br />
            This vision also influenced the design of new decks in the English
            school. For example, in the Tarot de Marseille and other traditional
            decks, card number 1 (The Magician) shows a young street illusionist
            in a somewhat hesitant posture. But in the Golden Dawn vision card 1
            should represent a high spiritual degree, and the figure was
            modified accordingly. In Waite’s 1909 deck the same card displays a
            powerful magic master who looks self-confident in his commanding
            authority, with the symbol of infinity hovering over his head.
            <br /><br />
            Still, this reading of the suit sequence as descending from high
            above to earth seems problematic if we examine the card themes more
            closely. The first cards of the suit (with low numbers) show figures
            whose social role and status is clear. For example, they show a
            street magician, an empress, a warrior and a wandering hermit. In
            contrast, the last cards show celestial bodies and nude human
            figures in mysterious and imaginary situations. These include, for
            example, a girl pouring water under the stars, an angel blowing his
            trumpet over three figures rising from the ground, and a dancing
            woman surrounded by four divine living creatures. Looking at these
            images, we may think that perhaps it’s the first cards which are
            earthly and mundane, while the last cards hint to a more lofty and
            mysterious level of reality. <br /><br />
            Another clue in this direction comes from the traditional use of the
            cards for gaming. In old Tarot games, as in most ordinary card games
            today, a card with a high number wins over a card with a low number.
            The last cards in the suit have the greatest value, beating all the
            cards that precede them. It is reasonable then to suppose that their
            themes are meant to represent the higher levels of reality, not the
            lower ones. <br /><br />
            Such considerations motivated other authors from the French school
            to adopt an opposite reading. In their view, the suit described a
            ladder of reality levels which extends from the material to the
            purely spiritual. But contrary to the previous reading, the suit
            sequence advances from bottom to top. The first cards are earthly
            and the last cards heavenly, not the other way around.

        <!-- Parts of the Suit -->
        <div class="chapter p-container mt-10 mb-0 hidden">
          <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl underline my-6">Parts of the Suit</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            For a better understanding of the major suit sequence and its
            evolution, let us examine its different parts in more detail. Most
            of the cards at the beginning of the suit show figures with a
            well-defined social status or professional activity. The street
            magician, the empress, the pope, the warrior in a chariot or the
            wandering hermit are all figures that have their place in the social
            world of the Middle Ages. Most of the figures in these cards are
            large enough to fill the whole card, and they are all dressed in a
            way that fits their status and occupation. Thus, at the beginning of
            the suit we can see people living in normal human society.
            <br /><br />
            Later on in the suit, we see allegorical figures of virtues
            cherished by medieval Christian society: Justice, Force, and
            Temperance. The figures are still large and fully dressed, but now
            they represent general ideas and not concrete people. Their actions,
            such as holding a lion by the mouth or the act of pouring liquid
            between two pots, also seem more like symbolic representations
            rather than things that real people actually do. <br /><br />
            To these we can add another allegory: The Wheel of Fortune which is
            differently designed, but shows a traditional symbol of ups and
            downs in social position. Together these cards can represent the two
            basic concepts of virtue and fortune, which are very typical in
            Renaissance thinking. Renaissance scholars debated the question
            whether virtue, which is a person’s moral quality, or fortune, which
            is capricious luck, is more important in human life. Thus, although
            these four cards show abstract concepts rather than particular
            people or social roles, they still operate in the earthly sphere of
            human life. <br /><br />
            The next part of the suit does not refer any more to social
            positions or accepted norms. Instead, we see disruptive and
            challenging cards which are detached from the common social order.
            The figures in these cards have no status marks, their actions seem
            mysterious or supernatural, and some of them are nude. The Hanged
            Man shows a man in an unusual situation, and it is unclear whether
            it expresses suffering or a choice to mortify himself. Card 13 shows
            a skeleton with a sickle in a field of amputated limbs. The Devil
            card with an insolent bisexual body and two tied imps mocks the
            conventional norms. Even The Tower card, which at first sight might
            seem to be a realistic image of lightning hitting a tall structure,
            rather hints at “fire from heaven” with the mysterious reference to
            God’s house in its title. <br /><br />
            Towards the end of the suit we see another kind of change, not only
            in the themes but also in the structure of the cards. Now they are
            vertically divided between some action on the ground and some object
            or figure in the sky. The human figures are smaller, and many of
            them are partially or fully nude. In contrast to the concrete
            activities or the simple allegories at the beginning of the suit, it
            is now unclear what exactly the figures are doing and why they are
            doing it. Who is the nude girl in The Star card and why is she
            pouring water into the river? What is the relation between her and
            the star which gives the card its name? And what about the two
            semi-nude children under the sun, or the two dogs and the crustacean
            under the moon? All of these are far removed from the common world
            of practical life and simple allegories. Instead they look
            mysterious, mythological and dream-like.
            <br /><br />
            As in any pattern in the cards, here too there is no uniform and
            orderly development. Rather it is a complex story with twists,
            jumps, and exceptions. The different parts of the suit
            interpenetrate each other with no clear separation between them. The
            Lover card appears at the beginning of the suit, although its
            structure resembles the last part: a division between ground and
            sky, several small figures, and even a nude angel or Cupid.
            Temperance appears at the middle of the suit as a large fully
            dressed figure and in a relaxed attitude, in contrast with the
            dramatic character and the nude figures of its surrounding cards.
            And at the end of the suit, The World has a symmetric and formal
            structure of its own which does not resemble any other card.

            Closeness & Exposure
          </h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            In the first half of the major suit almost all of the figures are
            dressed. Some of them are also heavily covered, for example by
            shawls and coverings in The Popess card, or by an armor in The
            Chariot card. In contrast, many figures in the second half of the
            suit are nude to some degree: partly nude in The Sun and The World
            cards, fully nude in The Devil, The Star and Judgment cards, and
            naked “to the bones” in Card 13. The appearance of so many nude
            figures in Tarot is surprising, especially if we remember that the
            cards were designed in a conservative era.
            <br /><br />
            Usually, in our society nudity is associated with sexuality. But the
            only card where nudity seems to appear in a sexual context is The
            Devil, whose semihuman figures are lewd and shameless rather than
            sexually attractive. It seems that the appearance of nudity in the
            cards is not about sex. Instead, it could be linked to the idea of
            social status. At the beginning of the major suit, the clothing not
            only covers the body but also tells us something about the position
            and the profession of the person. All the figures are dressed in a
            way which expresses their social occupation: an armor for the
            combatant, a royal gown for the emperor, a simple robe for the
            hermit. The same is true in real life. In a traditional society
            there are clear rules as to who may wear what clothes, and in our
            society too one can usually guess a person’s occupation and status
            by the way he dresses. <br /><br />
            Towards the end of the suit, the signs of social status disappear
            along with the clothing. Neither the names of the cards nor any
            details in their illustrations tell us who these people are and what
            is their social position. This removes the figures from the context
            of earthly life. Interestingly, along with the removal of social
            signifiers, a new structure appears in the card illustrations. Now
            they show things happening on two levels: one on the ground
            (earthly) and the other in the sky (heavenly). <br /><br />
            The appearance of the sky may also signify an opening to a higher
            level of reality and consciousness. It is like entering the reading
            space or the circle of the magical ritual. We establish contact with
            higher spheres by letting go of our mundane social identity and our
            defenses, so that we stand exposed in our mysterious existence as
            human being. This may be the reason why in many cultures it is
            common to perform rituals of magic in the nude, or in a uniform and
            simple dress which avoids all distinctions of social status.
            <br /><br />
            When people enter the reading they become exposed, revealing
            intimate details of what goes on in their life and mind. This is one
            of the most impressive features of Tarot reading: how quickly and
            intensively people open up and share contents that they usually keep
            sealed and hidden, from others and sometimes also from themselves.
            But doing so, they expose themselves as human beings who share the
            same worries and concerns regardless of social status, wealth or
            level of education. In front of the mysterious forces that we can
            feel through the cards, we are all just plain humans. The nudity of
            the figures may just be the cards’ way of reminding us of this.
            <br /><br />
            In a reading, nudity can also be part of the symbolic language of
            the cards. It can symbolize exposure, openness and the removal of
            defenses and barriers. The association of nudity with a heavenly
            level in the cards can also signify openness to messages from higher
            spheres. In a negative sense it can be interpreted as dangerous
            exposure, vulnerability and defenselessness. On the other hand,
            tight and heavy clothing can signify suspicion, closure, difficulty
            to let go, necessity to keep up defenses and self-preservation.
            <br /><br />
            The landscape in the card illustrations can also reflect the
            opposition of open and closed. An open field expresses exposure and
            removal of barriers. Walls and other obstructing constructions
            signify defenses and blocking. We can interpret the clothing or the
            nudity of a figure in terms of attempts to keep oneself protected or
            to become exposed, while the nature of the surrounding landscape can
            signify the amount of openness or closure that the environment
            provides. <br /><br />
            As with any pattern in the cards, the interplay between closed or
            dressed on one hand, and open or nude on the other hand, is not
            linear and uniformed. Starting around the middle of the suit, after
            every open or nude card there is a card with blocking structures or
            dressed figures, and vice versa. In The Hanged Man (12) the figure
            is dressed and blocked from all its sides by a wooden frame. Card 13
            presents extreme nudity to the bones, and card 14 shows the figure
            of Temperance dressed to its neck. Card 15 presents the Devil and
            his imps brazenly nude, while card 16 shows a brick construction and
            clothed figures. The Star (17) again presents a free and flowing
            nudity in an open field, while The Moon (18) shows a blocked
            landscape with sealed towers. But now a third option appears, a sort
            of fusion between open and closed, with the low wall and the partial
            nudity of The Sun card (19). Judgment (20) again shows nude figures,
            and here even the earth and the sky open up to each other. The suit
            ends in The World card (21) with a new combination of open and
            closed: a nude figure, partially covered by a light scarf, dancing
            inside a soft protective garland.

        <div class="chapter p-container mt-10 mb-0 hidden">
          <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl underline my-6">The Fool's Journey</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            We can’t know for sure the intentions of the original creators of
            the Tarot. But if they did have some Neo-Platonic ideas in mind, it
            seems more likely that they meant to indicate a progression from the
            mundane to the heavenly and not the other way around. Examined in
            this way, we can interpret the sequence as a dynamic story of
            personal evolution or as an initiation quest. The story begins with
            a person’s awakening from being enclosed in the earthly world of
            social status and material possessions. The journey passes through
            self-trials and the endurance of hardships which leads to a full
            realization of human existence with spiritual awakening, openness,
            and self-exposure. <br /><br />
            In the New Age movement this reading became popularly known as “The
            Fool’s journey.” The idea is that the numbered cards of the suit
            represent consecutive stages of a spiritual quest. Only the
            exceptional Fool card does not seem to represent any particular
            stage. Instead he is the traveler himself, the person who is going
            through the journey. Step by step he advances through the stages
            signaled by all the other cards, finally reaching his full
            realization with the image of The World.
            <br /><br />
            This idea is best exemplified with the Tarot de Marseille, in which
            The Fool card is exceptional because it has no number. This is
            different from the Golden Dawn vision that saw The Fool (no. 0) as
            the final goal of the journey, not as the person going through it.
            We may also see a hint of this idea in the derivation of the name
            Tarot from “The Fool’s cards.” In the cards’ language, maybe the
            fool carries in his bag all the other cards, taking out each one as
            he reaches corresponding stations along the way. <br /><br />
            There were many versions of The Fool’s journey, following the first
            introduction of this idea by the New Age Tarot writer Eden Gray.
            Here is a version inspired by the Conver-CBD images of the Tarot de
            Marseille. It is not meant to be “the true story” behind the suit
            sequence, nor is it the universal model to be followed by any
            spiritual seeker. The cards can be re-arranged in many possible
            combinations, and anyone can find his or her own way through them.
            Instead, the narrative of The Fool’s journey is a way to put in our
            mind the idea of the major suit sequence as a coherent story with a
            direction, sense and purpose, before going into the details of each
            separate card.

            The Wheel of Fortune, with the number 10 (which is significant in
            numerology) can be regarded as a turning point of the story. The
            rotating wheel can symbolize the cycles of normal life with their
            ups and downs. For example, it can represent the repeating cycle of
            working days from waking to sleep. It can symbolize a week or a
            year, with their regular cycles of holidays and communal gatherings.
            It can also stand for the cycle of generations in a family. And in
            Buddhist terms we can see it as Samsara, the repeating cycle of
            birth and rebirth.

            The cards with numbers lower than 10 can represent stages of growing
            up in normal society. The Magician, as the number 1, represents the
            first awakening of our own individuality. His tools spread upon the
            table can stand for capacities and potentials that may or may not be
            realized. The four following cards are significant figures of
            authority that influence our early years: parents in The Empress (3)
            and The Emperor (4), teachers in The Popess (2), and The Pope (5).

            The Lover card (6), with its unusual design for this part of the
            suit, turns our attention back to the individual, now coming out of
            his childhood years. The figure standing between two women possibly
            indicates the choices that we make as young adults, with
            consequences that accompany us for the rest of our lives. And the
            appearance of the heavenly Cupid in the card may symbolize the
            uplifting and near-mystical quality of our first encounters with
            love.

            We can see the next three cards as a single unit. The Chariot (7)
            and The Hermit (9) can represent two opposites. The Justice card (8)
            with its scales and sword can be weighing them one against the
            other, as well as “cutting” and choosing between them in a
            particular moment. For example, we can see the serene adult figure
            in the middle as striking a balance between the young and the old
            figures on its two sides. The chariot may symbolize youthful vanity
            and the desire to go out and conquer the world, while The Hermit
            stands for maturity and a cautious outlook based on experience.
            Alternatively, The Chariot can symbolize an occupation with external
            achievements, while The Hermit indicates an inner quest for wisdom
            and self-awareness. The Justice card can also represent the laws and
            norms of society, which govern both our external actions and the
            shaping of our inner values.

            All this is part of human life in normal society. The quest for
            awakening to a higher level of existence starts only after The Wheel
            of Fortune card. The Force (11), with a woman taming a lion whose
            head comes out of her own pelvis, can signify a moral battle with
            oneself in order to control one’s animal desires. The mysterious
            Hanged Man (12) carries his own self-examination to the extreme. By
            hanging himself upside down he is putting in question all his
            previous assumptions about what is above and what is below. He also
            takes a risk by giving up the solid base of accepted reality as he
            hovers above an abyss with his hands held behind his back.

            The next group of cards show dramatic challenges and trials with a
            transformative effect. The dark appearance of Card 13 makes it stand
            out among all the other cards. Even its missing title may hint at
            things too scary to be named. The sturdy skeleton figure, the sharp
            edge of the scythe and the severed heads and limbs indicate
            disintegration and irrevocable change. The crowned head on the right
            can symbolize past authority figures and guiding values which are
            now thrown down and trampled over.

          </figcaption>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The Temperance card (14) appears as a temporary relief with gentle
            reconciliation and appeasing of tensions. It may signify taking some
            time to work out patiently the outcome of the extreme trial in the
            previous card. It may also be needed before facing the lascivious
            paradoxes and the bawdy anarchism of desires stemming from the dark
            lower levels of The Devil (15). In The Tower (16) we can see the
            collapse of old established structures and values, but also an
            opening to higher forces coming from above. Also, it can represent
            giving up high-rise vain illusions, and coming down to the humble
            but fertile ground of actual existence. <br /><br />
            The three following cards can signify together an awakened state
            that comes after those trying experiences. Now life on earth are
            infused with an awareness of higher levels symbolized by the
            appearance of heavenly bodies above. But we can also see it as
            another evolution: from the naive full exposure in The Star (17),
            through the confrontation with deep and obscure layers of the mind
            in The Moon (18), and finally the arrival at the balanced and
            restrained acceptance of heavenly bliss in The Sun (19).

            The last two cards, whose imagery is taken from the traditional
            Christian vision of final redemption, may indicate the desired state
            of spiritual consciousness at the end of the quest. In the Judgment
            card (20) we see the heaven, the earth and the abyss opening towards
            each other. The spiritual vertical axis meets the earthly horizontal
            axis, and the three figures can bring to mind a psychological
            reparation of the initial relations with the parent figures. The
            balanced and symmetric World card (21) is the final station of the

            Still, this sublime vision can also be a trap. From a perfect
            situation there is nowhere to go, no place for further improvement.
            Perhaps it is better to think of the Fool’s journey not as a
            straight line but as a circle repeating itself on a higher level
            each time. With this vision we can interpret the strange oblong
            shape between The Magician’s table legs both as an opening from
            which he is born, and as an emptied form of The World’s wreath, now
            perceived as a womb. As The World gives birth to The Magician, it is
            time to start the journey once again. <br /><br />
            We may also think that the very image of the cards as fixed stations
            on a linear track is too restricted. Maybe it is better see it as
            just one possible story among many. A richer image appears in a 1932
            fantasy novel by Charles Williams called The Greater Trumps (an
            old-fashioned name for the major suit cards). Williams imagines the
            Tarot cards as three-dimensional golden figures. They move
            incessantly in an complex dance which reflects the great dance of
            life. Looking at the dance of the Tarot figures, one can understand
            and predict the corresponding movements of real life events.
            <br /><br />
            Amid all the dancing figures, only The Fool appears to be standing
            motionless. It is said that whoever understands the meaning of this
            fact will decipher the great secret of the Tarot. The secret as such
            isn’t revealed in the book. But we can find a hint to it in one of
            the female characters, which is a sort of an enlightened person with
            all-encompassing love. Only she sees The Fool constantly jumping to
            and fro, disappearing and re-appearing once again, each time filling
            the empty gaps between the other cards.

        <!-- Hebrew Letters -->
        <div class="chapter p-container mt-10 mb-0 hidden">
          <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl underline my-6">Hebrew Letters</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Many writers in both the French and the English school believed that
            the 22 cards of the major suit corresponded to the 22 letters of the
            Hebrew alphabet. This correspondence was significant for them
            because traditional Cabbalistic texts attach spiritual meanings and
            magical powers to the Hebrew letters. But each of the two schools
            had their own method for establishing the exact correspondences.
            <br /><br />
            The founder of the French tradition, Eliphas Lévi, matched the first
            letter Aleph to The Magician which is the first card in the suit.
            Lévi also saw the shape of the Magician’s body, with one arm raised
            above and the other below, as hinting to the shape of the Hebrew
            letter Alef. He matched the second letter Beth with The Popess card
            (number 2) and so on, proceeding by the standard ordering of the
            Hebrew alphabet. <br /><br />
            This correspondence creates other interesting links between the
            cards and the letters, some of which Lévi may have been aware of.
            The letter Kaf was matched to The Force card. Kaf in Hebrew means
            “palm,” like the palms holding the lion in the card. The Hanged Man
            in Card 12 with his bent leg resembles the shape of the letter
            Lamed. The letter Mem was matched to Card 13 which is sometimes
            called Death (mavet in Hebrew). The Devil got Samekh, the initial
            letter of Samael which is the devil’s name in Hebrew. The body and
            the legs of the falling figure on the left of The Tower card are
            similar to the shape of the letter Ayin. Lévi also put The Fool at
            the place before the last, matching it with the letter Shin. This is
            the initial letter of shoteh, which in Hebrew means fool. Tav is the
            initial of tevel, which in Hebrew means the world. <br /><br />
            The English school of Tarot adopted a different system. As The Fool
            card was moved to the top of the suit, it was matched to the first
            letter Aleph. The rest of the cards were matched according to the
            sequence order, which made Beth correspond to The Magician, Gimel
            (the third letter) to The Popess and so on. This correspondence may
            seem strange to those who know Gimatria, the traditional notation of
            numbers by Hebrew letters which is very important in the Cabbala.
            For example, Beth in Gimatria is 2, but in the Golden Dawn method it
            corresponds to card number 1. Nevertheless, The Golden Dawn leaders
            adopted it. Later, Crowley further modified their correspondence by
            switching between the letters of The Emperor and The Star.
            <br /><br />
            The result is that there are different ways of matching the Hebrew
            letters with the Tarot cards. This is a bit confusing because in
            several new decks the Hebrew letters are explicitly written on the
            cards. As some of these do it by the English system and others by
            the French system, different decks show different letters on the
            same card.
            <br /><br />
            For an open reading on personal issues with the Tarot de Marseille
            the question is not so important, as the Hebrew letters don’t
            actually appear on the cards. Therefore, the whole issue can just be
            ignored. Still, readers who speak Hebrew or know the Cabbala can use
            the correspondences as an additional layer of meaning for the cards.
            For example, there are many who believe that a person’s name has an
            influence on his life. To understand the influence of a specific
            name we can write it down in Hebrew, lay down the corresponding
            cards in a row and read them. A similar method can be used with
            Cabbalistic letter combinations which are supposed to have positive
            effects. Doing this, we can create a luck-bearing talisman made from
            Tarot cards. Alternatively, a card appearing in a spread can be
            given a specific meaning by looking for a person or a place whose
            first initial is the corresponding Hebrew letter.
            <br /><br />
            If we wish to use a Hebrew letter correspondence, which system
            should we adopt? A reasonable choice would be to go by the deck we
            are using. With the Tarot de Marseille and other French-school
            decks, we may use Eliphas Lévi’s system of correspondences. With
            decks from the English school such as Waite’s, we may use the Golden
            Dawn system. If you don’t know to which school your deck belongs,
            it’s a good idea to check the numbers of Justice and The Force. In
            the French school Justice is 8 and The Force is 11, and in the
            English school it’s the other way around.
